# Machine_learning

1. Machine learning (ML) is a subset of Artificial Intelligence(AI) that enables computers to learn from data and improve their performance on specific tasks without being explicitly programmed.
2. Type of machine learning:
  1.Supervised: algorithm is trainned on a labeled data where eacch input is associated with the corresponding output means algorithm learn to map input with outputs and allow to make prediction on new unseen data.EX: image classification, speech recognition, regression task.
  2.Unsupervised: Work on unlabelled data , actually the goal is to uncover patterns, structures, or relationships within the data without explicit guidance,so clustering and dimensionality are common application.
  3. Reinforcement: it is inspired by behavarial technolongy, the algorithm learn by interacting with an environment and receving feedback in form of rewards and penlaties. the objective to discover best action and leads to maximum rewards Ex: in robotics ,games playing and recommendation system
3. Real World Application of Machine learning:
     a. Natural Language Processing(NLP) : enables machines to understand ,interpret and generate 
         human language beaucuse the virtual assitant like siri and chatbots that extensively useit
     b. Medical Diagnostics: analyze the medical images like xprays and MRI to detect diseases
     c. Financial Services: for analyze the fraud by bank and officers
     d. Recommendation System: for product recommendation by amazon,netflix
     e. Autonomous Vehicles: self driving cars
     f. Predictive Analytics: forcast the future trends and outcomes
